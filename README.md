# v0.1.34 (2025-02-20) - Slow Burn  ## Commercial Use Licensing  A dedicated individual commercial use license for  `komorebi` [is now available](https://lgug2z.com/software/komorebi).  As a reminder, the [Komorebi License](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi-license) is strictly for personal use only and forbids any kind of commercial use - if you want to use `komorebi` at work, you need to purchase an individual commercial use license.  ### Notes  [A fix in this release](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi/commit/b8e8ac2cc9f4ceea966b0bf74703ecb1a070f673) changes undefined behaviour which previous users may have unknowingly come to rely on:  - `focus-workspace` and related commands no longer forcibly focus the monitor at the cursor position before being executed (this was a pretty terrible case of UB to begin with, particularly for anyone who had `mouse_follows_focus` disabled) - If you want this same behaviour going forward, you should chain [`komorebic focus-monitor-at-cursor`](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi/commit/be8af2b314cfe21e0451e6d39e24cd2df210db3f) with your `focus-workspace` commands (eg. `komorebic focus-monitor-at-cursor && komorebic focus-workspace 1`.  ### Bug Fixes  * **bar**: removed unneeded separator character on network widget ([`d1680133`](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi/commit/d16801337539404ec711d1cd70bb3fdd250c6d82)) * **wm**: set default hiding behaviour to cloak ([`475519d6`](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi/commit/475519d6034a94e20677db719ae3632068726f82)) * **docs**: correct sp in example-configurations.md ([`9f19d449`](https://github.com/LGUG2Z/komorebi/commit/9f19d449b2307b02e9ba9de9e6ea66ce599f4eb6)) * **docs**: update base16 gallery link

**This release features commands for dumping Linux kernel nftables internals, initial support for LoongArch64 architecture, fix for GDB 16+, improved LLDB support, few commands improvements as well as lots of fixes!**  See **What's changed** and **Community Contributions** for a summary of user-facing changes from this release and a list of other relevant contributions from the Pwndbg team and contributors.  Want to support us or buy us a coffee? See our [Pwndbg sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/pwndbg)!  ## What's changed  ### General * Added commands for dumping Linux kernel nftables internals: `knft_dump`, `knft_list_tables`, `knft_list_chains`, `knft_list_rules`,  `knft_list_exprs`, `knft_list_sets`, `knft_list_objects` and `knft_list_flowtables` (#2679) * Added initial support for LoongArch64 architecture   * Native GDB/LLDB disassemblers are used to display the code in "disasm" context section (#2693)   * Capstone disassembly, Unicorn Engine emulation or Pwnlib related features are not there yere (we wait for upstream libraries releases support this arch which should happen in Capstone 6 and Unicorn 2.20) * The `cymbol` command can now load symbols from header files with the `-f header-filepath.h` flag (#2661) * The `dumpargs` command can now display formatted bit flags - currently only for mmap flags (#2740) * The IDA/Binary Ninja integration server can now be configured via `PWNDBG_{BINJA,IDA}_SERVER_HOST` and `PWNDBG_{BINJA,IDA}_SERVER_PORT` environment variables (#2746) * Speed up installation by moving to `uv` package manager - useful for CI builds (#2726) * Updated Unicorn Engine to 2.1.2 (#2731) * Argparse parsing errors are now displayed more user-friendly (#2711) * Fixed aglib's `reg_write` API when writing to PC register (#2539) * Fixed `procinfo` and `xinfo` commands when remote debugging (#2732) * Fixed the `onegadget` command printing redundant memory access errors (#2682) * Fixed the `mp`, `arena` and `tcache` ptmalloc2 glibc heap inspection commands (#2724, #2729) * Fixed IPython autocompletion in `ipi` command on portable installation (#2739) * Fixed PowerPC rs6000 architecture (#2741)  ### GDB * Added support for GDB 16+ (#2686) * Added a workaround for GDB TUI ANSI escape sequence translation bug (#2721) * Fixed `pwndbg.aglib.file.get_file` corrupting downloaded files due to incorrect gdbstub data decoding (#2730) * Fixed setting/syncing of parameters set via `set <param> <value>` (#2749) * Fixed `gdb.Value` format failure in when context sections displayed the `last_signal` section (#2753)  ### LLDB * Added fallback/support for architectures supported by LLDB but not supported by Capstone disassembly engine like LoongArch64 (#2693)  * Fixed process handling when attaching to process and added support for `attach <pid|name>` (#2685, #2705) * Fixed behavior on `detach` (#2709) * Ported `version` and `bugreport` commands (#2708)  ...and many many others (updates to docs, developer docs, installation, CI workflows, refactorings etc)  **Also thanks to new contributors: @podd0 (#2715), @0xRavenspar (#2661) and @LorenVS (#2740)!**  **Full Changelog since previous release (2025.01.20) can be found at: https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/compare/2025.01.20...2025.02.19**  ## Community Contributions Our team and Pwndbg contributors are actively contributing to the broader open-source ecosystem. Here are some of their contributions: * We reported [two QEMU bugs with its gdbstub](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/issues/2751) and [fixed the one impacting us](https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/-/commit/8b647bd352505234cab2acd2422aba183a1aa1fd) by @disconnect3d.  * @disconnect3d [sent a patch](https://sourceware.org/pipermail/gdb-patches/2025-February/215391.html) to GDB to fix [an `info proc mapping` bug reported a year ago](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=31207). * @disconnect3d [fixed a PPC target compilation error in Unicorn Engine](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn/pull/2104). * @k4lizen optimized the [glibc heap](https://github.com/bminor/glibc/commit/e2436d6f5aa47ce8da80c2ba0f59dfb9ffde08f3) which got released in glibc 2.41. * @k4lizen reported [a few bugs in GDB recently](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?f1=reporter&o1=equals&order=Importance&query_format=advanced&resolution=---&v1=k4lizen%40proton.me): incorrect GOT entries, an assertion failure and an UAF when deleting breakpoints. * @patryk4815 [fixed a bug in esp32-openocd downstream fork](https://github.com/espressif/openocd-esp32/pull/352) concerning incorrect sending of RISC-V registers in its gdbstub. * @patryk4815 debugged programs on rp2350 with OpenOCD and found several bugs related to gdb server protocol packets, reported her [here](https://sourceforge.net/p/openocd/tickets/449/). * @patryk4815 reported two issues in LLDB: missing aliases for registers in [RISC-V](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/124023) and [LoongArch](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/123903) architectures; and also [missing files in Capstone PyPi packages](https://github.com/capstone-engine/capstone/issues/2621). * @OBarronCS sent [a fix for MIPS64 architecture to Unicorn Engine](https://github.com/unicorn-engine/unicorn/pull/2111). * @OBarronCS sent a [feature request to Pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools/issues/2539) so that its `asm` function would allow specifying extensions of a target architecture (e.g. ["Zbs" extension of RISC-V](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-b))  ## Which version to download?  Don't know which version to download? Here are two helpful tables: the first one, with portable packages and the second one with packages for each Linux distro.  All of those builds include and use the same version of all Pwndbg dependencies (GDB 15.2, Python 3.12.8, latest Pwndbg, Capstone 5.0.5, Unicorn Engine 2.1.2, Pwntools 4.14.0, OneGadget etc.).  For install instructions [see our README](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg?tab=readme-ov-file#instructions). Pwndbg can also be installed with Nix package manager as detailed [here](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg?tab=readme-ov-file#how).  | Platform            | Pwndbg GDB                                                                                                                                                   | Pwndbg LLDB                                                                                                                                                            | |---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------| | Apple Silicon macOS | [pwndbg_2025.02.19_macos_amd64-portable.tar.xz](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/download/2025.02.19/pwndbg_2025.02.19_macos_amd64-portable.tar.xz) | [pwndbg-lldb_2025.02.19_macos_amd64-portable.tar.xz](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/download/2025.02.19/pwndbg-lldb_2025.02.19_macos_amd64-portable.tar.xz) | | Intel macOS         | [pwndbg_2025.02.19_macos_amd64-portable.tar.xz](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/download/2025.02.19/pwndbg_2025.02.19_macos_amd64-portable.tar.xz) | [pwndbg-lldb_2025.02.19_macos_amd64-portable.tar.xz](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/download/2025.02.19/pwndbg-lldb_2025.02.19_macos_amd64-portable.tar.xz) | | x86-64/AMD64 Linux  | [pwndbg_2025.02.19_x86_64-portable.tar.xz](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/download/2025.02.19/pwndbg_2025.02.19_x86_64-portable.tar.xz)           | [pwndbg-lldb_2025.02.19_x86_64-portable.tar.xz](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/download/2025.02.19/pwndbg-lldb_2025.02.19_x86_64-portable.tar.xz)           | | x86-32/i686 Linux   | [pwndbg_2025.02.19_x86_32-portable.tar.xz](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/download/2025.02.19/pwndbg_2025.02.19_x86_32-portable.tar.xz)           | [pwndbg-lldb_2025.02.19_x86_32-portable.tar.xz](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/download/2025.02.19/pwndbg-lldb_2025.02.19_x86_32-portable.tar.xz)           | | ARM64 Linux         | [pwndbg_2025.02.19_arm64-portable.tar.xz](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/download/2025.02.19/pwndbg_2025.02.19_arm64-portable.tar.xz)             | [pwndbg-lldb_2025.02.19_arm64-portable.tar.xz](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/download/2025.02.19/pwndbg-lldb_2025.02.19_arm64-portable.tar.xz)             | | ARMv7 Linux         | [pwndbg_2025.02.19_armv7-portable.tar.xz](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/download/2025.02.19/pwndbg_2025.02.19_armv7-portable.tar.xz)             | [pwndbg-lldb_2025.02.19_armv7-portable.tar.xz](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/download/2025.02.19/pwndbg-lldb_2025.02.19_armv7-portable.tar.xz)             | | RISC-V/64 Linux     | [pwndbg_2025.02.19_riscv64-portable.tar.xz](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/download/2025.02.19/pwndbg_2025.02.19_riscv64-portable.tar.xz)         | [pwndbg-lldb_2025.02.19_riscv64-portable.tar.xz](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/download/2025.02.19/pwndbg-lldb_2025.02.19_riscv64-portable.tar.xz)         | | PPC64 Linux         | [pwndbg_2025.02.19_powerpc64-portable.tar.xz](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/download/2025.02.19/pwndbg_2025.02.19_powerpc64-portable.tar.xz)     | [pwndbg-lldb_2025.02.19_powerpc64-portable.tar.xz](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/download/2025.02.19/pwndbg-lldb_2025.02.19_powerpc64-portable.tar.xz)     | | PPC64LE Linux       | [pwndbg_2025.02.19_powerpc64le-portable.tar.xz](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/download/2025.02.19/pwndbg_2025.02.19_powerpc64le-portable.tar.xz) | [pwndbg-lldb_2025.02.19_powerpc64le-portable.tar.xz](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/download/2025.02.19/pwndbg-lldb_2025.02.19_powerpc64le-portable.tar.xz) | | S390x Linux         | [pwndbg_2025.02.19_s390x-portable.tar.xz](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/download/2025.02.19/pwndbg_2025.02.19_s390x-portable.tar.xz)             | [pwndbg-lldb_2025.02.19_s390x-portable.tar.xz](https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg/releases/download/2025.02.19/pwndbg-lldb_2025.02.19_s390x-portable.tar.xz)             |   | Linux distros                              | Pwndbg GDB -
