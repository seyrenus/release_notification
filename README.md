### 2024-02-23T10:43:14Z [**TodePond/DreamBerd**](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd)

```
Over the years, many people have tried [and failed](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd/discussions/183) to implement DreamBerd. No one has been able to do it...  *Until today!*  Introducing [Vivaan Singhvi](https://vivaansinghvi07.github.io/), a highschool student who has now created the world's first mostly-functional [Dreamberd interpreter](https://github.com/vivaansinghvi07/dreamberd-interpreter). This is extremely impressive, as it's a task that many experienced programmers have struggled with.  **[As promised](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd/releases/tag/v3.0), I have now donated [£99](https://www.dreamberd.computer/investment/pre-seed-extension/) to a charity of Vivaan's choice, [Second Harvest Food Bank](https://secondharvestetn.org/).**  The money will pay for approximately 375 meals for children and families experiencing hunger. I now invite you to [donate](https://donate.secondharvestetn.org/site/Donation2?idb=2120474203&df_id=1480) as well! If you do so, please let me know on social media by tagging @TodePond. I'll give you a boost!  > And now I want to show you how well the interpreter fared up with DreamBerd. Here's the analysis.   # Implementation report  ## Exclamation marks  > **🏆 Complete pass**  All exclamation mark syntax worked well. Notably, the debug information I got from my question mark was clear and helpful.  c print("Hello world")! print("Hello world")!!! print("Hello world")? if (;false) {    print("Hello world")! }   Console:  Hello world Hello world Hello world  exclamation-marks/bold.db, line 3    print("Hello world")?   ^^^^^ Expression evaluates to value undefined.  Hello world   ## Const const  > **🏆 Complete pass**  c const const name = "Luke"! print(name)!   Luke   ## Const var  > **🏅 Lenient pass**  The `pop` method from the example didn't work, but constant variables worked as expected with other methods.  c const var name = "Lu"! name.push("ke")! print(name)!   Luke   ## Var const  > **🏆 Complete pass**  c var const name = "Luke"! name = "Lu"! print(name)!   Lu   ## Var var  > **🏅 Lenient pass**  Similar to above, the `pop` method didn't work, but `push` worked fine.  c var var name = "Luke"! name = "Lu"! name.push("ke")! print(name)!   Luke   ## Const const const  > 💰 **Untested**  For the [first bounty](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd/releases/tag/v3.0), a global "const 3" server is not needed, so I didn't test this.  However, the interpreter does state that it supports const 3!  ## Unicode naming  > **🏅 Buggy pass**  The `1️⃣` emoji didn't work, but most other emojis do work. Notably, the `True` value was correctly interpreted as a string!  c const const letter = 'A'! var const 👍 = True! var var 🐦 = 1!  print(letter)! print(👍)! print(🐦)!   A True 1   ## Number naming  > **🏆 Complete pass**  I had to add in some extra whitespace because the interpreter partially implements the parentheses features of DreamBerd, which are not required or tested as part of this [first bounty](https://github.com/TodePond/DreamBerd/releases/tag/v3.0).  c const const 5 = 4! print( 2 + 2 == 5 )!   true   ## Negative one index arrays  > **🏆 Complete pass**  c const const scores = [3, 2, 5]! print(scores[-1])! print(scores[0])! print(scores[1])!   3 2 5   ## Float array indexing  > **💥 So close!**  This should print `[3, 2, 4, 5]` instead.  c const var scores = [3, 2, 5]! scores[0.5] = 4! print(scores)!   [3, 4, 2, 5]   ## When  > 🏆 **Complete pass**  This was one of the first features I tried. Amazing!  c var var health = 10! when (health == 0) {    print("You lose")! }  print("You got hit")! health = 0!   You got hit You lose   ## Line-based lifetimes  > 🏆 **Complete pass**  c const const name<2> = "Luke"! print(name)!   Luke Error   ## Time-based lifetimes  > **💥 Failure**  This caused an error.  c const const name<20s> = "Luke"! print(name)!   ## Infinity-based lifetimes  > 🏆 **Complete pass**  I genuinely can't believe this worked. I ran one program that set an infinite-lifetime constant...  c const const foreverName<Infinity> = "Luke"!   Then I ran another program to read it and print it out.  c print(foreverName)!   Luke   ## Loops  > 🏆 **Complete pass**  There are no loops.  ## Booleans  > **🏅 Lenient pass**  The interpreter is based off a slightly older version of DreamBerd that uses the `after` keyword instead of `addEventListener`. I didn't test those older features, but I tested that you can use the `maybe` boolean value still. The interpreter seems to treat `maybe` like a string, which is fine I guess.  c const const isTuesday = maybe! print(isTuesday)!   maybe   ## Significant whitespace  > **🏆 Complete pass**  Amazing. Love it.  c print( 1 + 2*3 )! print( 1+2 * 3 )!   7 9   ## Powers  > **🏆 Complete pass**  c print(1^1)! print(2^3)!   1 8   ## Number names  > **🏆 Complete pass**  Incredible.  c print( one + two )! print( thirteen + two )!   3 15   ## Indentation  > **🏅 Lenient pass**  The interpreter allows indents of multiples of 3, which is standard practice among DreamBerd implementations.

# 2024.02.14 Release  Here is the 2024.02.14 release. Thanks to everyone who contributed!  **Among others, this release brings GOT tracking mechanism, more step/break commands, mmap/mprotect syscalls, printing of linked lists, displaying of threads in context for multithreaded programs, lots and lots of fixes and more!**  The release files can be used to install Pwndbg as self-contained (along with GDB, Python and all deps) package on many distros and x86-64 and arm64/aarch64 architectures. The `*-portable.tar.gz` archives can be just unpacked and run.  Below is a summary of changes, while the full changelog can be found further on.  Note: this release requires Python >= 3.8 (which means Ubuntu 18.04 or Debian 10 are not supported anymore).  ## Summary of changes **General changes:** - Added portable Pwndbg archive to release as well as nix, rpm, deb, arch and alpine packages - Added `$base(objfile_name)` function to compute base address of given memory page, e.g. `print $base(libc)+0x123` will return base of libc + 0x123 - Context will now display threads information for multi-threaded programs   - this is limited by `context-max-threads` parameter (use `set context-max-threads <N>` to change) - Added glibc heap exploitation support for libc 2.12+ (#1823) - Added support for FreeBSD (#1832) - The `gdb-pt-dump` git submodule was moved to a python dependency (#1929)  **New commands:** - `track-got {enable,disable,info,query} ...` can be used to track (#1971) - `stepuntilasm <asm>` will step through program instructions until a matching part of instruction string is found (#1798) - `break-if-taken <loc>` and `break-if-not-taken <loc>` will setup a breakpoint on given location of a branch instruction which will stop the program if the branch was taken or not (#1799) - `plist ...` can be used to print linked lists (#1795, #1817) - `mmap ...` and `mprotect ...` commands will invoke the `mmap` or `mprotect` syscalls with given arguments in the debugged program   - note: this works by assembling a shellcode for the syscall call, placing the code on current PC/IP address, executing the syscall and reverting back the register and memory changes made - `thread` command to display threads information - `hi` command to check if an address belongs to a glibc heap chunk (#1938) - `tips` to display tips about Pwndbg usage - `sigreturn <address>` to print sigreturn x86-64 frame (#1940)  **Changed commands:** - Added `telescope --frame` to display stack frame information (requires BP and SP to point to the same memory region) (#1855) - Glibc heap commands now also print real chunk size (#1748) - Added `spray --only-funcptrs | -x` flag to spray only the memory addresses where values point to executable memory pages (#1809) - Added `-A <N>` and `-B <N>` flags to `vmmap` to display N entries after/before the filtered page (#1810) - The linux kernel memory pages figured out by gdb-pt-dump can now be filtered in `vmmap` (they have unique names) (#1837) - Added new arguments/options to the `search` memory command (#1867) - `telescope` output can now show frame pointer offsets (#1925) - `distance <single-address>` now prints offset from memory page start address (#1926) - Added `stack -i | --inverse` to show stack in reverse order (#1978) - Added new positional argument to `cyclic` command to save its output to file (so it can later be used, e.g. as `run < input`) (#2009)  ##
