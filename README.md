```
First of all, massive thanks to @paxcut, @iTrooz and @jumanji144 who fixed and maintained ImHex while I was not around.  ## Features - Added a loop node to the data processor     - This should allow for much more complex data processing - Added support for enumerating system fonts on Linux. Thanks to @ColinKinloch  - The pattern hover tooltip of the hex editor now shows the offset to its parent - Massive improvements to the Pattern Editor. Huge thanks to @paxcut      - The editor works much more like other editors     - There's way too many improvements to list them all. Just try it out yourself! - Added a quarter precision option to the IEEE 754 tool - Added customizable segment separators to the hex editor view - Added annotations to the data information view where big entropy dips or spikes are detected - Added an export option to the disassembler view. Thanks to @BioTheWolff  - Added "Disassemble selection" option to the Edit menu - Added Image base address and Image load address options to the disassembler - Added option to paste strings into the hex editor view  ## Improvements - Improved and modernized the look and feel of various views - Demangling now works correctly with identifiers that do not start with an underscore - The data processor now runs in the background so it doesn't freeze up the UI anymore - The table in the diff view is now resizable - When clicking on a diff in the diff view, the same region is now being selected in the main hex editor view - Hovering over patterns in the hex editor should not tank the frame rate anymore in some cases - Pattern descriptions are now being displayed in the accept pattern popup - stderr is not being completely suppressed anymore now - Inline visualizers may now be used in custom data inspector rows - Improved 3D visualizer error handling - Improved naming and shortcut display for various menu items - Command palette results (such as the calculator) may now be clicked to move their result back into the palette input - Updated ImGui to latest version  ## Bug Fixes - ImHex won't try to connect to the API anymore on startup now if server contact is disabled - The log is no longer being spammed with error messages now if an invalid data region is being viewed in a process data provider - Fixed 3D visualizer textures not being rendered correctly - Fixed issues when hashing large data regions - Fixed multiple race conditions that could crash ImHex while patterns were being sorted - Achievements should no longer reset now after a restart - Fixed issue where CRC64 parameters in the hash view were limited to 32 bit - Fixed issues with shortcuts using CTRL instead of CMD on macOS - Fixed inserting bytes at the start of the file using insert mode not working correctly  ## Pattern Language - Added various new built-in types     - Types such as `hex::type::Json` for decoding json strings or `hex::type::Instruction` for disassembling bytes. - Added option to import existing patterns into other patterns.      - You can for example use `import * from elf as ELF;` and then place the `ELF` type anywhere you want to decode ELF data there. - Added lz4 decompression support - Added reinterpret-expressions in the form of `pattern as OtherType`.      - If both sides have the same size, this will interpret the bits of `patterns` as a `OtherType` type - Added functions to change the pattern color palette and reset the current palette progress - Processing patterns after evaluation has finished should be much quicker now - The bitmap visualizer can now handle indexed colormaps. Thanks to @paxcut  - Added `[[fixed_size]]` attribute to set the minimum size of a type to a fixed value or throw an error if the type gets larger than this - Enums are no longer evaluated on every use - Added user-defined literals in the form of `123_literal` or `"Test"_literal(1, 2, 3)` - Added a `IMPORTED` macro that's defined when a file is being imported by another - Various preprocessor and lexer improvements. Thanks to @paxcut   > [!NOTE] > - Ubuntu 22.04 support has been dropped in favor of 24.04 and 24.10. Please use the AppImage or Flatpak if you're still on a older version > - Support for Fedora 39 has been dropped in favor of Fedora 41. Please use the AppImage or Flatpak if you're still on a older version > - The macOS builds require macOS 13.0 now at least since GitHub retired their old macOS 12.0 runners. Please update your machine to the latest macOS version to keep using ImHex or compile it yourself from sources. <br/>  <p align="center">If you like my work, please consider supporting me on GitHub Sponsors, Patreon or PayPal.

# Release notes for xrdp v0.10.2 (2024/12/24)  ## General announcements  [Power Up Privacy](https://powerupprivacy.com/) and @CyberTrust sponsored H.264 encoding (mentioned later).  We greatly appreciate the sponsorship.   If you like xrdp, please consider sponsoring or donating to the project. We accept financial contributions through [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/xrdp-project), and direct donations to individual developers via GitHub Sponsors are also welcome.  ## Highlights  ### H.264 encoding  We’re very excited to announce that xrdp has supported H.264 encoding in graphics remoting since v0.10.2. xrdp with H.264 encoding reduces the amount of data transmitted over the network and provides a much smoother and more responsive experience compared to previous versions when using graphics-intensive applications.  For details, see the [H.264 encoding](https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp/wiki/H.264-encoding) page on the wiki and also check the [Known Issues](https://github.com/neutrinolabs/xrdp/wiki/H.264-encoding#known-issues) section.  ### Unprivileged xrdp daemon  Since v0.10.2, xrdp officially supports running `xrdp` daemon as an unprivileged user. `xrdp-sesman` daemon still needs to be run as a privileged user because it handles user authentication and session management.  Running `xrdp` daemon as an unprivileged user requires some adjustments, such as user/group and files/directory permissions. We have bundled a script named `xrdp-chkpriv` with xrdp to check if it is ready to run `xrdp` as an unprivileged user. The script is typically installed into `/usr/share/xrdp/xrdp-chkpriv`. See also the man page of `xrdp.ini` for more configuration information.  ## Security fixes None  ## New features * FUSE operations can now use direct I/O to bypass the block cache (#3260) * Supported clients can now skip channel join messages (#3282) * Frame capture interval (frame rate) can now be configured separately via xrdp for H.264 and RFX (neutrinolabs/xorgxrdp#347 #3317) * The statvfs system call is now supported on the FUSE filesystem (#3304) * A path can now be specified for the chansrv log file (#3344) * Add Czech keyboard (#3348 #3358)  ## Bug fixes * Redirector improvements. Removed some unnecessary limitations on filename lengths, and improved compatibility with FreeRDP (#3165 #3194). Special thanks to @tsz8899 for raising this and working with the team. * Fix misreported cache size (#3212) * Clarified Policy setting in sesman.ini (#3235) * Fixed a regression in support for non-resizeable VNC sessions (#3242) * A regression in chansrv functionality when used in standalone mode for VNC sessions has been fixed (#3283). This was introduced by the move to the v0.10.x sockets dir layout * Fix AltGr on Spanish keyboard (#3313) * The KDE Dolphin file manager can now save files to a mapped drive (#3300) * pam_limits.so is now included explicitly for Debian and derivatives (#3347)  ## Internal changes * CI version updates : cppcheck to v2.15.0 and astyle to 3.4.14 (#3232 #3309 #3314) * Remove xrdp_sec_in_mcs_data() function (#3273)  ## Changes for users  * `xrdp.ini` has some new configuration parameters for H.264 (#3317). When updating from v0.10.1 to v0.10.2, make sure to merge the new `xrdp.ini` with the old one. * If moving from v0.9.x, read the v0.10.0 release note.  ## Changes for packagers or developers  * `xrdp.ini` and `sesman.ini` are now dynamically substituted during the build process (it was not working as intended before) (#3187 #3188) * Running xrdp daemon as an unprivileged user is now officially supported. It is optional but consider creating a user/group for `xrdp` daemon in the post-install script or an appropriate location. * The libfuse version required is now > 3.1.0 (#3284) * If moving from v0.9.x, read the v0.10.0 release note.

```
* [Milestone](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/milestones/1.25.0)  In this release, the coding focus has been on [moving to PHP 8.1+](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS/discussions/5474) and refactoring the integration of the SimplePie library (which was long due). At the same time, plenty of new features have been added. Enjoy! 🎄  Breaking changes 💥: * Require PHP 8.1+ (and improved support of PHP 8.4+) * Require PostgreSQL 10+ or MariaDB 10.0.5+ or MySQL 8+  A few highlights ✨: * Add support for [regex search (regular expressions)](https://freshrss.github.io/FreshRSS/en/users/10_filter.html#regex) 	* ⚠️ Advanced regex syntax for searches depends on the database used (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MySQL), 		but FreshRSS filter actions such as auto-mark-as-read and auto-favourite always use [PHP PCRE2 syntax](https://php.net/regexp.introduction). * Allow dynamic search operator in user queries, like `search:UserQueryA date:P1d` * New feed mode *HTML+XPath+JSON dot notation* (JSON in HTML) * Better HTTP compliance with support for HTTP response headers `Cache-Control: max-age` and `Expires` * New unicity policies and heuristic for feeds with bad article IDs (reduce the problem of duplicated articles) * New option to automatically mark new articles as read if an identical title already exists in the same category * Add ability to remove content from articles with CSS selectors, also when not using full content * New condition option to selectively retrieve full content of articles * New UI feature to download a user’ SQLite database or a database SQLite export (to be produced by CLI) * Supported by [Capy Reader](https://github.com/jocmp/capyreader) (Android, open source) * Many bug fixes, UI improvements, and a lot more  This release has been made by @aledeg, @Alkarex, @Art4, @ColonelMoutarde, @Frenzie, @math-GH, @ramazansancar and newcomers @DevGrohl,
