# Release Notes for Cyphernetes v0.15.0  This one took a bit longer than our usual release cycle but packs a real punch! This release includes the biggest refactoring of the codebase to date.  For starters, the heart of Cyphernetes has been fully rewritten from scratch. This release does away with the `goyacc` dependency as the parser has been reimplemented as a recursive descent function, while the lexer has been rewritten to be more straightforward and maintainable. This change will allow the parser to deliver better, contextual messages on parsing errors - as well as serving for a better platform for future development of the language.  Next, the single `parser` Cyphernetes package has been broken down into 3 packages: - `core`: This is the package that provides the `Parse` method - It contains the language parser, relationship engine and other parts that together provide that Cyphernetes magic - `provider`: This is an interface that allows the core package to interface with a data backend - contains functions for doing CRUD operations as well as resolving resource kind names and other schema related functionality - `apiserver`: A default provider implementation - this is the original K8s go-client used by Cyphernetes up until now.  This change allows for easier integration of the Cyphernetes language into other Go projects and opens up the possibility of including Cyphernetes in products that use other backends that reflect the contents of etcd (e.g. Postgres, Elasticsearch…) for looking up resources. For the first time, we publish an [Integration guide](https://github.com/AvitalTamir/cyphernetes/blob/main/docs/INTEGRATION.md) in our docs.  Besides these two major changes, the refactoring job includes many bug fixes, performance improvements and enhancements to usability. More than anything, we received a lot of user feedback over the past couple of months! Thank you! This helped us address several important issues and come up with feature ideas.    ## Features - Full rewrite of the core Cyphernetes package - Support for dry-run mode - Shiny progress bars when initializing resource specs - Add `version` command - New `—format` flag for YAML output support in query/shell commands  ## Improvements  - Blazing fast cluster spec initialization - Support fully qualified kinds (e.g. `deployments.apps`) - Warn on kind ambiguity, present list of available fully-qualified names - Allow access to non-namespaces resources (`nodes`, `namespaces`…) without explicitly setting “all-namespaces” - More relationships now discovered automatically  ## Bug Fixes - Namespace hardcoded to `default` on web caused missing results when namespace was defined in local Kubernetes context - Ambiguous	resource kinds of different groups crashed the program  - `—namespace` was ignored by Cyphernetes shell - now takes precedence   # Acknowledgements We have a new maintainer! We also have some fresh code contributors and new issue reporters - It's amazing to see the Cyphernetes community growing like that. Thanks to everyone who contributed!   🥇 New maintainer: We are welcoming @naorpeled as a maintainer for the Cyphernetes repo 🥳  Over the last few months Naor has consistently been contributing and demonstrated responsibility and true care for the project. I'm honored to have him by my side as an official Cyphernetes maintainer, good luck Naor - You're already doing an awesome job.  🎖️ For reporting issues:  @scraly @SleepyBrett @elliotxx @hmizael  🏅 In the PR department: @viniciusartur  @noetarbouriech

# Git Repo Config Support  `gh-dash` will now look for a `.gh-dash.yml` file if you run it from a git repo. This allows you to define sections that are specific to this repo, and aren't suited for the global config. Use cases include seeing PRs by teams you work closely with, issues sorted by reactions for your OSS project etc.  ## Changelog * a5f99ce1532a4765c8298bb49139eaf18a9cdbac Update LICENSE.txt, fix license year * 666aeba6b2676d91187940bb61df12a178970a3c feat: read .gh-dash.yml file in repo root if exists

## rqbit v8.0.0  Why a major release? Lots of merged PRs since v7.0.1, minor breaking changes in librqbit API and CLI naming. Other than that, it's a checkpoint to release all the work by many contributors.  ### Breaking changes - Minimal Rust version bumped from 1.75 to 1.78 - CLI parameters changes:     - renamed disable-upnp -> disable-upnp-port-forward     - removed upnp-server-hostname     - added enable-upnp-server - librqbit API changes: if any, they are minor, but might be some depending on usage. All should be easy to fix just by resolving compilation errors.  ### UI features - There's a banner in the bottom showing total up/down speed and uploaded/downloaded bytes since restart - Upload multiple files through UI  ### Some Other features - upload/download rate limits - watching a directory for .torrent files and adding them automatically (usage in #237) - Improved UPNP server support. Now works on some Samsung TVs, and should be more reliable overall.  ### HTTP API changes - [/playlist](https://github.com/ikatson/rqbit/blob/main/crates/librqbit/src/http_api.rs#L171) URLs - basic auth support (see #279 for usage)  ### BitTorrent protocol features - BEP-47 padding files - BEP-53 select only files from magnet - BEP-11 Peer EXchange  ## What's Changed * feat: add on_piece_completed method on TorrentStorage by @cocool97 in https://github.com/ikatson/rqbit/pull/219 * PEX -

EDIT: I forgot to update version number in this release, see https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/issues/4382  ## What's Changed  No breaking changes. Mostly fixes to existing bridges, and some new bridges.  But, beware that all bridges are now enabled by default! (instead of the selected handful).  If you dont want all bridges enabled do like this in `config.ini.php`:  ini [system]  ; Only these 3 bridges are enabled enabled_bridges[] = CssSelectorBridge enabled_bridges[] = FeedMerge enabled_bridges[] = FeedReducerBridge  ;enabled_bridges[] = *   ## Noteworthy changes  When debug mode is enabled, php errors are converted to exceptions! Only in debug mode, not in prod mode.  * fix: convert php errors to exceptions when in debug mode by @dvikan in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/4176  ## The future  These needs to be discussed:  * Bump min php version from 7.4 to 8.0. * Introduce a new document root with separate data folder (e.g. `/var/www/rss-bridge/public` and `/var/www/rss-bridge/var/`) * rss-bridge is trivially vulnerable to XSS in the `HtmlFormat` page since we dont sanitize the html(mostly harmless since theres not much to exploit). Feed readers do sanitize html so no problem there. * rss-bridge is trivially vulnerable to SSRF (mostly harmless? hard to exfiltrate data) Also we actually want to allow to fetch resources from non-public IP addresses, so maybe introduce a config for this allowance  See also https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/issues/2735  ## New Contributors  Thanks all!  * @zamentur made their first contribution in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/3947 * @gi-yt made their first contribution in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/4076 * @facutuesca made their first contribution in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/4092 * @Albatrosicks made their first contribution in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/4111 * @vlnst made their first contribution in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/4131 * @mazzz1y made their first contribution in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/4154 * @enwuenwu made their first contribution in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/4156 * @NotsoanoNimus made their first contribution in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/4160 * @quent1-fr made their first contribution in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/4189 * @bloominstrong made their first contribution in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/4247 * @osvfj made their first contribution in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/4263 * @AlexanderS made their first contribution in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/4260 * @tbelbek made their first contribution in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/4293 * @jonastaedcke made their first contribution in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/4271 * @TangentFoxy made their first contribution in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/4317 * @deffy92 made their first contribution in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/4318 * @swofl made their first contribution in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/4330 * @thomas-333 made their first contribution in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/4341 * @Okbaydere made their first contribution in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/4355 * @Vynce made their first contribution in https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/pull/4359  **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/compare/2024-02-02...2025-01-02

# 1.7.7: Time Dilation  A quick-fix release following reports after releasing the 1.7.6 release.  ## Issues  ### Drawing issue  After the previous release some users experienced rofi being rendered to screen as a black box. The issue seems to be only hit on certain video cards/drivers see the github issue [#2068](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/issues/2068).It turned out on these systems using `cairo_push/pop_group` results in a black screen when the backing surface is using the XCB library. When using other drivers, or rendering to a cairo image surface. Hopefully reverting to `cairo_store` and `cairo_restore` fixes this issue for everybody.  Issue [#2068](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/issues/2068)  ### Window mode missing some windows  Because of a wrong check some windows where misidentified as 'skip pager' and hidden from the view. This should now be resolved.  Issue [#2071](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/issues/2071)  ### 'Character' in config file broken  A previous patch to make using strings more easy to use in the configuration file broke settings that use the 'character' type as setting. Because not a lot of options use the 'Character' type , this has been 'resolved' by using the 'String' type and picking the first ASCII character.   Issue [#2070](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/issues/2070)  ## improvements  Beside these issues, also some improvements are included in this release.   ## Resolve 'rasinc' for @imports  When importing a theme file like this:  css @import "mytheme"   Rofi would find any file 'mytheme.rasi' in any of the theme paths. This was missing the new extension for shared include files 'rasinc'. This is now added when resolving.  Issue [#2069](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/issues/2069)  ## Desktop file DBus activation  Some desktop files did not launch correctly because it did not implement the DBusActivation feature. While most desktop files did provide a fallback `Exec` entry, this seems to not always be the case. Rofi should now first try DBusActivation and fall back to the Exec if it does not succeed.  Issue [#1924](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/issues/1924)  ## Resolve `-config` identical to `-theme`  if you pass an alternative config file, this is now resolved using the same logic as the `-theme` argument. Making it easier to have multiple, alternative, configuration files.  Issue [#2040](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi/issues/2040)  ## Changelog  * [Widget] Don't use cairo_push/pop_group as it causes issues. (#2068) * Revert "[window] Check bitmask, not full comparison".  (#2071) * [Config] Remove character data type as it aliases with string. (#2070) * [Doc] Refer to releasenotes for updates in Changelog file. (#2069) * [Doc] Update theme documentation with import resolving update. (#2069) * [Themes] Update themes to import without rasi(nc) extensions. (#2069) * [Theme] Fix resolving of 'rasinc' extension when no extension is given. (#2069) * Be more diligent trying to resolve -config. (#2040) * Use FALSE instead of FALSE. * Resolve -config argument identical to a -theme argument. (#2040) * [DRun] If indicated by .desktop file, launch via dbus activation. (#1924) * [Website] Update website links and headers.
