# Release Notes for Cyphernetes v0.15.2  This release contains a critical bug fix to the parser where quoted key names inside node properties (i.e. `(d:Deployment {"name":"foo"})`) would get ignored potentially leading to selecting or mutating all resources of the specified kind instead of only the ones matching the selector.  We also added an additional E2E test for the core package (so far we've only been running E2E for the operator).  This version also contains a few important bug fixes - Thanks @wendorf for reporting issues!  ## Improvements - Web client will now try to assign another port if the one requested is taken - Support stars as array indexes in WHERE clauses - E2E test for core package  ## Bugfixes - Properly handle quoted keys in node properties - Completion generation should not try to get current Kubernetes context - Web interface not properly detecting port conflicts

# Summary  This release significantly enhances GPU utilization through a new tensor transaction mechanism for batched sync operations and simultaneous reads of multiple bindings for CubeCL runtimes. It also includes multiple performance optimizations like mixed precision support for matrix multiplication and convolution operations, as well as notable GEMM improvements.  Backend capabilities have been expanded with a new remote backend for distributed computing, improved SPIR-V support, custom operations fusion and an experimental fused matrix multiplication.  Training components have been expanded to support semantic segmentation and object detection datasets, new training metrics and improved training performance thanks to an async metric processor.  As with previous releases, this version includes various bug fixes, further performance optimizations, new tensor operations and enhanced documentation.  # Module & Tensor -

After supporting 130 languages, HanLP has officially released an [open-source Ancient Chinese model](https://hanlp.hankcs.com/docs/api/hanlp/pretrained/mtl.html#hanlp.pretrained.mtl.KYOTO_EVAHAN_TOK_LEM_POS_UDEP_LZH). This model supports automatic word segmentation, lemmatization, part-of-speech tagging, and dependency parsing for Ancient Chinese. Thanks to multi-task learning, this single model can handle all of these tasks, as well as coarse-grained/fine-grained segmentation and UPOS/XPOS/PKU part-of-speech tagging sets.  - Blog post: https://www.hankcs.com/nlp/hanlp-ancient-chinese-processing-model-released.html - Demo: https://github.com/hankcs/HanLP/blob/master/plugins/hanlp_demo/hanlp_demo/lzh/demo_mtl.py - Performance: https://hanlp.hankcs.com/docs/api/hanlp/pretrained/mtl.html#hanlp.pretrained.mtl.KYOTO_EVAHAN_TOK_LEM_POS_UDEP_LZH - Visualization:  ![hankcs com 2025-01-12 at 4 47 53 PM](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcf7aa09-9027-4fab-a20f-0bed65343ac3)   **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/hankcs/HanLP/compare/v2.1.0...v2.1.1
