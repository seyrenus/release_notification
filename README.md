## Security Fixes This release contains security fixes for the following advisories. And we strongly advice to update as soon as possible.  - [GHSA-f7r5-w49x-gxm3](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/security/advisories/GHSA-f7r5-w49x-gxm3)   This vulnerability is only possible if you do not have an `ADMIN_TOKEN` configured and open links or pages you should not trust anyway. Ensure you have an `ADMIN_TOKEN` configured to keep your admin environment save. - [GHSA-h6cc-rc6q-23j4](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/security/advisories/GHSA-h6cc-rc6q-23j4)   This vulnerability is only possible if someone was able to gain access to your Vaultwarden Admin Backend. The attacker could then change some settings to use sendmail as mail agent but adjust the settings in such a way that it would use a shell command. It then also needed to craft a special favicon image which would have the commands embedded to run during for example sending a test email. - [GHSA-j4h8-vch3-f797](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/security/advisories/GHSA-j4h8-vch3-f797)   This vulnerability affects all users who have multiple Organizations and users which are able to create a new organization or have admin or owner rights on at least one organization. The attacker does need to know the Organization UUID of the Organization it want's to attack or compromise though.  ## Notable changes - Updated web-vault to v2025.1.1 - Added partial *manage* role support for collections - Manager role is converted to a Custom role with either Manage All Collections or per collection.   Admins and Owners probably want to check and verify if the rights are still correct. - The OCI containers and binaries are _signed_ via [GitHub Attestations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/using-artifact-attestations/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds#verifying-artifact-attestations-with-the-github-cli)   This allows you to verify an OCI image or even the `vaultwarden` binary located within the OCI image.   These vulnerabilities affects   ## What's Changed * Add `inline-menu-positioning-improvements` feature flag by @Ephemera42 in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5313 * Fix issues when uri match is a string by @BlackDex in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5332 * Add TOTP delete endpoint by @Timshel in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5327 * fix group issue in send_invite by @stefan0xC in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5321 * Update crates and GHA by @BlackDex in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5346 * Refactor the uri match fix and fix ssh-key sync by @BlackDex in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5339 * Add partial role support for manager only using web-vault v2024.12.0 by @BlackDex in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5219 * Fix issue with key-rotate by @BlackDex in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5348 * fix manager role in admin users overview by @stefan0xC in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5359 * Prevent new users/members to be stored in db when invite fails by @BlackDex in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5350 * Update crates and web-vault to v2025.1.0 by @BlackDex in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5368 * Allow building with Rust v1.84.0 or newer by @BlackDex in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5371 * rename membership and adopt newtype pattern by @stefan0xC in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5320 * build: raise msrv (1.83.0) rust toolchain (1.84.0) by @tessus in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5374 * Fix an issue with login with device by @BlackDex in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5379 * refactor: replace static with const for global constants by @Integral-Tech in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5260 * Add Attestations for containers and artifacts by @BlackDex in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5378 * Fix version detection on bake by @BlackDex in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5382 * Simplify container image attestation by @dfunkt in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5387 * improve admin invite by @stefan0xC in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5403 * Add manage role for collections and groups by @BlackDex in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5386 * update web-vault to v2025.1.1 and add /api/devices by @stefan0xC in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5422 * Security fixes by @BlackDex in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5438 * only validate SMTP_FROM if necessary by @stefan0xC in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5442  ## New Contributors * @Ephemera42 made their first contribution in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5313 * @Integral-Tech made their first contribution in https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/pull/5260  **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden/compare/1.32.7...1.33.0

```
Wave Terminal v0.11.0 includes a major rewrite of our connections infrastructure, with changes to both our backend and remote file protocol systems, alongside numerous features, bug fixes, and stability improvements.  A key addition in this release is the new shell initialization system, which enables customization of your shell environment across local and remote connections. You can now configure environment variables and shell-specific init scripts on both a per-block and per-connection basis.  For day-to-day use, we've added search functionality across both terminal and web blocks, along with a terminal multi-input feature for simultaneous input to all terminals within a tab. We've also added support for Google Gemini to Wave AI, expanding our suite of AI integrations.  Behind the scenes, we've redesigned our remote file protocol, laying the groundwork for upcoming S3 (and S3-compatible system) support in our preview widget. This architectural change sets the stage for adding more file backends in the future.  - **Shell Environment Customization** -- Configure your shell environment using environment variables and init scripts, with support for both local and remote connections - **Connection Backend Improvements** -- Major rewrite with improved shell detection, better error logging, and reduced 2FA prompts when using ForceCommand - **Multi-Shell Support** -- Enhanced support for bash, zsh, pwsh, and fish shells, with shell-specific initialization capabilities - **Terminal Search** -- use Cmd-F to search for text in terminal widgets - **Web Search** -- use Cmd-F to search for text in web views - **Terminal Multi-Input** -- Use Ctrl-Shift-I to allow multi-input to all terminals in the same tab - **Wave AI now supports Google Gemini** - Improved WSL support with wsh-free connection options - Added inline connection debugging information - Fixed file permission handling issues on Windows systems - Connection related popups are now delivered only to the initiating window - Improved timeout handling for SSH connections which require 2FA prompts - Fixed escape key handling in global event handlers (closing modals) - Directory preview now fills the entire block width - Custom widgets can now be launched in magnified mode - Various workspace UX improvements around closing/deleting - file:/// urls now work in web widget - Increased max size of files allowed in `wsh ai` to 50k - Increased maximum allowed term:scrollback to 50k lines - Allow connections to entirely be defined in connections.json without relying on ~/.ssh/config - Added an option to reveal files in external file viewer for local connection - Added a New Window option when right clicking the MacOS dock icon button - [build] Switched to free Ubuntu ARM runners for better ARM64 build support - [build] Windows builds now use zig, simplifying Windows dev setup - [bugfix] Connections dropdown now populated even when ssh config is missing or invalid - [bugfix] Disabled bracketed paste mode by default (configuration option to turn it back on) - [bugfix] Timeout for `wsh ssh` increased to 60s - [bugfix] Fix for sysinfo widget when displaying a huge number of CPU graphs - [bugfix] Fixes XDG variables for Snap installs - [bugfix] Honor SSH IdentitiesOnly flag (useful when many keys are loaded into ssh-agent) - [bugfix] Better shell environment variable setup when running local shells - [bugfix] Fix preview for large text files - [bugfix] Fix URLs in terminal (now clickable again) - [bugfix] Windows URLs now work properly for Wave background images - [bugfix] Connections launch without wsh if the unix domain socket can't be opened - [bugfix] Connection status list lights up correctly with currently connected connections - [bugfix] Use en_US.UTF-8 if the requested LANG is not available in your terminal - Other bug fixes, performance improvements, and dependency updates  ## PRs * Separate out Yarn major updates into separate Dependabot groups by @esimkowitz in https://github.com/wavetermdev/waveterm/pull/1607 * Rename outdated

The link can open in a new tab, the same tab, or not at all—it's your choice.  Note: This feature is designed to open the link only if you manually click the wake button. Additionally, the link will open only in the specific browser session where the action is performed, not in others.  ![Bildschirmfoto 2025-01-23 um 12 16 39](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33334a50-1c96-4c51-aaeb-53fe03b5ad74)  ## Changelog ### Features * 973a1b80d0ec9c37bbcf3df9b1df39d220b5042a: feat: add device description field (@seriousm4x) * 0e427585131763300f8b82cd013d510af8c61d0d: feat: auto open device link after wake (@seriousm4x) ### Bug fixes * 8906b2b6cea9ddefd156b7346a88cc58b42c8b89: fix: dependabot ignore major releases (@seriousm4x) * 8cb100552d2c3cd0521f5183b5d71e58d2370fc1: fix: grammar in shutdown description (@seriousm4x) ### Others * 558e6484d09b4b249ed1e4c40d67744303d6c2fd: format (@seriousm4x) * c926eb792e9bda80a912b95abbea42122ebd9fbe: pnpm format (@seriousm4x) ### Go dependencies * eea7ff492b6db7ba36664fbd3512e240fc5aa64d: go-dep: bump github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase in /backend (@dependabot[bot]) * 567fa46e77e1f5a5d0700e4bb61fdb447d80d118: go-dep: bump github.com/prometheus-community/pro-bing in /backend (@dependabot[bot]) ### Npm dependencies * d36da86fb748c89c93eff6960529e200d4cf397d: Revert "npm-dep: bump tailwindcss from 3.4.17 to 4.0.0 in /frontend" (@seriousm4x) * 4f015fbeee7d94162207f12ba89e655cb3d585de: npm-dep: bump @sveltejs/kit from 2.15.3 to 2.16.0 in /frontend (@dependabot[bot]) * 5189a2cbf2f1d0f02ee176bef479186276c84bfb: npm-dep: bump @sveltejs/kit from 2.16.0 to 2.16.1 in /frontend (@dependabot[bot]) * 42d35dfbd604b9cc565039b650b415f8e7103b72: npm-dep: bump pocketbase from 0.25.0 to 0.25.1 in /frontend (@dependabot[bot]) * 09d856e8ebe477b99f75735caa65c274dcde489c: npm-dep: bump tailwindcss from 3.4.17 to 4.0.0 in /frontend (@dependabot[bot]) * 9cd8cb21c92d50efcac54eca9a6e445a4d4bb74e: npm-dep: bump typescript-eslint from 8.20.0 to 8.21.0 in /frontend (@dependabot[bot]) * ef58ce188a743360c3ba9f8dcf9265612673bb95: npm-dep: bump vite from 5.4.11 to 5.4.12 in /frontend (@dependabot[bot])

# This is the final beta version, which can be regarded as stable  Most of issues fixed in this release are reported by `fontbakery` (the check tool used by Google Fonts), but there still exists some issues like missing unicode characters, which have no effect in most cases. So I plan to fix them in next major release. You can track the progress in #272.  ## Changelog  - optimize glyphs - fix version string - fix contour directions - add missing `−`, `Җ`, `җ`, `Ҳ`, `ҳ` - fix copyright and license - add missing gasp table - remove `-VF` in production - add missing glyphs #318 - fix license url - fix wrong `ss03` name - improve `S` / `s`  ## Download  [Which File to
