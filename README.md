### 2024-01-01T10:25:35Z [**Rongronggg9/RSS-to-Telegram-Bot**](https://github.com/Rongronggg9/RSS-to-Telegram-Bot)

```
### Enhancements  - **`wsrv.nl` via relay**: Try to use `wsrv.nl` (environment variable `IMAGES_WESERV_NL`) via the media relay server (environment variable `IMG_RELAY_SERVER`). This is a workaround for images from domains/TLDs banned by `wsrv.nl` or CDNs that ban `wsrv.nl`. It can hopefully reduce the frequency of seeing "invalid media" in messages since RSStT uses `wsrv.nl` heavily to convert images into formats accepted by Telegram DCs. See also [#369](https://github.com/Rongronggg9/RSS-to-Telegram-Bot/issues/369). - **Append enclosures to Telegraph post**: Append enclosures (if any) to Telegraph post if any. Previously, enclosures can only be sent in Telegram messages, but not in Telegraph posts. - **Dependencies update**: Bumped most outdated dependencies to the latest version. An optional dependency `isal` has been added to slightly improve the performance of entry hashing. - **L10n update**: Localizations have been updated. - **Misc refactoring**: Some code has been refactored to improve readability and maintainability.  ### Bug fixes  - **"Remote" `/test` unavailable**: Fix a bug preventing the bot manager from using the `/test` command "remotely". - **Resized images still too big**: Fix a bug causing images resized by `wsrv.nl` to be sometimes too big (exceed the 5MiB limitation of Telegram DC) to send. - **Sinaimg images not parsed properly**: Fix the URL regex of Sinaimg images. It can hopefully reduce the frequency of seeing "invalid media" in messages. - **WEBP fully fetched regardless of fetch limit**: Fix a bug causing WEBP without `Content-Length` header to be fully fetched regardless of the fetch limit. - **Entry hashing for monitor and sub not unified**: Unify the entry hashing for monitor and sub. Previously, the entry hashing for monitor and sub is not unified, which may cause the bot to send persisting entries (posts) after a feed is subscribed for the first time.  <hr>  ## v2.4.1: 次要的增强和 bug 修复，以及新年快乐！🎉  ### 增强  - **经反代的 `wsrv.nl`**: 尝试通过媒体反代服务器 (环境变量 `IMG_RELAY_SERVER`) 使用 `wsrv.nl` (环境变量 `IMAGES_WESERV_NL`)。这是对那些来自被 `wsrv.nl` 封禁的域名或将 `wsrv.nl` 封禁的 CDN 的图片的变通解决方案。考虑到 RSStT 大量使用 `wsrv.nl` 将图片转换为 Telegram DC 所接受的格式，这有望减少在消息中见到 "Invalid media" 的频率。另请参阅 [#369](https://github.com/Rongronggg9/RSS-to-Telegram-Bot/issues/369)。 - **将 enclosure 附加到 Telegraph 文章**: 如果有的话，将 enclosure (附件) 附加到 Telegraph 文章。先前，enclosure 只能在 Telegram 消息中发送，而无法在 Telegraph 文章中发送。 - **依赖项更新**： 将大部分过时的依赖项更新到了最新版本。引入可一个可选依赖 `isal` 用于稍微提升条目散列的性能。 - **本地化更新**: 本地化已被更新。 - **杂项重构**: 重构了一些代码以提高可读性和可维护性。  ### Bug 修复  - **“远程” `/test` 不可用**：修复阻止 bot 管理员“远程”使用 `/test` 命令的错误。 - **调节尺寸后的图像仍然太大**: 修复了一个错误，这个错误导致经过 `wsrv.nl` 调节尺寸后的图像有时候仍然太大（超过 Telegram DC 的 5MiB 限制）以至于无法发送。 - **Sinaimg 图片未被正确解析**: 修复了针对 Sinaimg (微博图床) 图片的正则表达式。这有望减少在消息中见到 "Invalid media" 的频率。 - **WEBP 被完全获取，而没有考虑获取限制**: 修复了一个导致不带有 `Content-Length` 标头的 WEBP 被完全获取，而没有考虑获取限制的错误。 - **监视器和订阅的条目散列不统一**: 统一监视器和订阅的条目散列。先前，监视器和订阅的条目散列不统一，这可能导致 bot 在一个 RSS 源被首次订阅后发送已经存在的条目 (文章)。

```
This release of fish includes a number of improvements over fish 3.6.4, detailed below. Although work continues on the porting of fish internals to the Rust programming language, that work is not included in this release. fish 3.7.0 and any future releases in the 3.7 series remain C++ programs.  ## Notable improvements and fixes * Improvements to the history pager, including:   * The history pager will now also attempt subsequence matches ([#9476](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9476)), so you can find a command line like `git log 3.6.1..Integration_3.7.0` by searching for `gitInt`.   * Opening the history pager will now fill the search field with a search string if you’re already in a search ([#10005](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10005)). This makes it nicer to search something with `↑` and then later decide to switch to the full pager.   * Closing the history pager with enter will now copy the search text to the commandline if there was no match, so you can continue editing the command you tried to find right away ([#9934](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9934)). * Performance improvements for command completions and globbing, where supported by the operating system, especially on slow filesystems such as NFS ([#9891](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9891), [#9931](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9931), [#10032](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10032), [#10052](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10052)). * fish can now be configured to wait a specified amount of time for a multi-key sequence to be completed,  instead of waiting indefinitely. For example, this makes binding `kj` to switching modes in vi mode possible. The timeout can be set via the new `fish_sequence_key_delay_ms` variable ([#7401](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7401)), and may be set by default in future versions.  ## Deprecations and removed features  * `LS_COLORS` is no longer set automatically by the `ls` function ([#10080](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10080)). Users that set `.dircolors` should manually import it using other means. Typically this would be `set -gx LS_COLORS (dircolors -c .dircolors | string split ' ')[3]`  ## Scripting improvements  * Running `exit` with a negative number no longer crashes fish ([#9659](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9659)). * `fish --command` will now return a non-zero status if parsing failed ([#9888](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9888)). * The `jobs` builtin will now escape the commands it prints ([#9808](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9808)). * `string repeat` no longer overflows if the count is a multiple of the chunk size ([#9900](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9900)). * The `builtin` builtin will now properly error out with invalid arguments instead of doing nothing and returning true ([#9942](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9942)). * `command time` in a pipeline is allowed again, as is `command and` and `command or` ([#9985](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9985)). * `exec` will now also apply variable overrides, so `FOO=bar exec` will now set `$FOO` correctly ([#9995](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9995)). * `umask` will now handle empty symbolic modes correctly, like `umask u=,g=rwx,o=` ([#10177](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10177)). * Improved error messages for errors occurring in command substitutions ([#10054](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10054)).  ## Interactive improvements * `read` no longer enables bracketed paste so it doesn’t stay enabled in combined commandlines like `mysql -p(read --silent)` ([#8285](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8285)). * Vi mode now uses `fish_cursor_external` to set the cursor shape for external commands ([#4656](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/4656)). * Opening the history search in vi mode switches to insert mode correctly ([#10141](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10141)). * Vi mode cursor shaping is now enabled in iTerm2 ([#9698](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9698)). * Working directory reporting is enabled for iTerm2 ([#9955](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9955)). * Completing commands as root includes commands not owned by root, fixing a regression introduced in fish 3.2.0 ([#9699](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9699)). * Selection uses `fish_color_selection` for the foreground and background colors, as intended, rather than just the background ([#9717](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9717)). * The completion pager will no longer sometimes skip the last entry when moving through a long list ([#9833](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9833)). * The interactive `history delete` interface now allows specifying index ranges like “1..5” ([#9736](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9736)), and `history delete --exact` now properly saves the history ([#10066](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10066)). * Command completion will now call the stock `manpath` on macOS, instead of a potential Homebrew version. This prevents awkward error messages ([#9817](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9817)). * A new bind function `history-pager-delete`, bound to `Shift` + `Delete` by default, will delete the currently-selected history pager item from history ([#9454](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9454)). * `fish_key_reader` will now use printable characters as-is, so pressing “ö” no longer leads to it telling you to bind `\\u00F6` ([#9986](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9986)). * `open` can be used to launch terminal programs again, as an `xdg-open` bug has been fixed and a workaround has been removed  ([#10045](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10045)). * The `repaint-mode` binding will now only move the cursor if there is repainting to be done. This fixes `Alt` combination bindings in vi mode ([#7910](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/7910)). * A new `clear-screen` bind function is used for `Ctrl` + `l` by default. This clears the screen and repaints the existing prompt at first, so it eliminates visible flicker unless the terminal is very slow ([#10044](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10044)). * The `alias` convenience function has better support for commands with unusual characters, like `+` ([#8720](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/8720)). * A longstanding issue where items in the pager would sometimes display without proper formatting has been fixed ([#9617](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9617)). * The `Alt` + `l` binding, which lists the directory of the token under the cursor, correctly expands tilde (`~`) to the home directory ([#9954](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9954)). * Various fish utilities that use an external pager will now try a selection of common pagers if the `PAGER` environment variable is not set, or write the output to the screen without a pager if there is not one available ([#10074](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10074)). * Command-specific tab completions may now offer results whose first character is a period. For example, it is now possible to tab-complete `git add` for files with leading periods. The default file completions hide these files, unless the token itself has a leading period ([#3707](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/3707)).  ### Improved prompts * The default theme now only uses named colors, so it will track the terminal’s palette ([#9913](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9913)). * The Dracula theme has now been synced with upstream ([#9807](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9807)); use `fish_config` to re-apply it to pick up the changes. * `fish_vcs_prompt` now also supports fossil ([#9497](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9497)). * Prompts which display the working directory using the `prompt_pwd` function correctly display directories beginning with dashes ([#10169](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10169)).  ### Completions * Added completions for:   * `age` and `age-keygen` ([#9813](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9813))   * `airmon-ng` ([#10116](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10116))   * `ar` ([#9720](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9720))   * `blender` ([#9905](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9905))   * `bws` ([#10165](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10165))   * `calendar` ([#10138](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10138))   * `checkinstall` ([#10106](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10106))   * `crc` ([#10034](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10034))   * `doctl`   * `gimp` ([#9904](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9904))   * `gojq` ([#9740](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9740))   * `horcrux` ([#9922](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9922))   * `ibmcloud` ([#10004](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10004))   * `iwctl` ([#6884](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/6884))   * `java_home` ([#9998](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9998))   * `krita` ([#9903](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9903))   * `oc` ([#10034](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10034))   * `qjs` ([#9723](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9723))   * `qjsc` ([#9731](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9731))   * `rename` ([#10136](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10136))   * `rpm-ostool` ([#9669](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9669))   * `smerge` ([#10135](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10135))   * `userdel` ([#10056](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10056))   * `watchexec` ([#10027](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10027))   * `wpctl` ([#10043](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10043))   * `xxd` ([#10137](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10137))   * `zabbix` ([#9647](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9647)) * The `zfs` completions no longer print errors about setting a read-only variable ([#9705](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9705)). * The `kitty` completions have been removed in favor of keeping them upstream ([#9750](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9750)). * `git` completions now support aliases that reference other aliases ([#9992](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9992)). * The `gw` and `gradlew` completions are loaded properly ([#10127](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10127)). * Improvements to many other completions. * Improvements to the manual page completion generator ([#9787](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9787), [#9814](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9814), [#9961](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9961)).  ## Other improvements * Improvements and corrections to the documentation. * The Web-based configuration now uses a more readable style when printed, such as for a keybinding reference ([#9828](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9828)). * Updates to the German translations ([#9824](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9824)). * The colors of the Nord theme better match their official style ([#10168](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10168)).  ## For distributors * The licensing information for some of the derived code distributed with fish was incomplete. Though the license information was present in the source distribution, it was not present in the documentation. This has been corrected ([#10162](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/10162)). * The CMake configure step will now also look for libterminfo as an alternative name for libtinfo, as used in NetBSD curses ([#9794](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/9794)).  ---  *Download links: To download the source code for fish, we suggest the file named "fish-3.7.0.tar.xz". The file downloaded from "Source code (tar.gz)" will not build correctly. The SHA-256 sum of this file is `df1b7378b714f0690b285ed9e4e58afe270ac98dbc9ca5839589c1afcca33ab1`. A GPG signature from David Adam (key ID `0x7A67D962D88A709A`) is available as "fish-3.7.0.tar.xz.asc".*
